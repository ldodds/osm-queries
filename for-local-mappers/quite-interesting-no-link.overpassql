/*
Finds a range of potentially interesting, historic or noteworthy locations that don't have a Wikidata link.

Of course, what you might consider interesting, historic or noteworthy might be different. And lack of a wikidata
link doesn't mean that there is a wikidata entry to link to, or that the location should have one.

But this might be a useful starting point to find locally significant places and either link them to wikidata,
perhaps adding a new entry if useful.
