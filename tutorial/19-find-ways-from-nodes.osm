/*
We previously looked at how to use the `>` operator to find members of ways.

But we can also go the opposite way and find ways from their nodes. We can do
this using the "recurse up" statement (`<`) which, as the arrow might suggest, goes in the
opposite direction.

This query finds all of the nodes in our bounding box and also the ways of which
they are members.

There's also a `<<` statement that will traverse from nodes all the way to to
the relations that contain them.
