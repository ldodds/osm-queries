/*
The OpenStreetMap data model consists of:

* nodes - single points, e.g a postbox or tree
* ways - a set of connected points, e.g. a path or a building
* relations - a grouping of ways and nodes, e.g. a collection of buildings

When you drill down from relations and ways you always end up with nodes. So
you can think of nodes as the most basic element of the data model: a point on
the globe with some data attached to it as tags (name-value pairs).

Our first query is one of the simplest possible OverpassQL queries. It select
the node that has an `id` of `1` from the OSM database. It then outputs some
information about that node.

We'll learn more about different ways to query for nodes, ways and relations in
other queries.

And we'll also learn how to control what information is extracted and output
from the database.

But, for this first query, the main things to note is that a query consists of
a series of statements. In this case there are two. Each statement ends with a semi-colon.

The first statement (`node(1)`) performs the query.

The second statement (`out`) creates the output.

More complex queries will consist of many more statements of different types.
But an OverpassQL queries is a list of statements that are executed by the API.
These statements build of sets of results that are then returned to the
user.

The Overpass Turbo user interface helpfully displays those results on a map. But
if you use the API directly, e.g. from a script or programme, then you can choose to
consume and use the data however you like.

To run the query, click the "Run in Overpass Turbo" link. A new window will open
containing your results. As you work through this tutorial, you're encouraged
to actually run the queries and, where suggested, customise them to explore
some of the features of the language.

In case you're wondering node number 1 happens to be a communications tower in
Italy. I have no idea why.

One important thing to note is that OpenStreetMap ids are not guaranteed to
be stable. Someone could come along delete a node and then it might later be recreated
by the same or a different user. But the node will end up with a new identifier.

When you use OverpassQL you're likely to be querying information based on their location
or metadata, rather than their identifier. Or, if you do, be prepared that the
nodes, ways or relations you're fetching might disappear in the future.
