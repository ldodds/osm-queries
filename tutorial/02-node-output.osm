/*

This query shows how to create different levels of detail in the output
from your query.

The `out` statement can be controlled by adding some parameters to it. These
are appended to the statement.

The parameters can be used to control things like:

* how much information is extracted about each node (or way, or relation)
* control how geographic information is output
* sorting and limiting results

In this query we are just looking at the first of these: how to control the
level of data provided for each node.

The different parameters are:

* `ids` - outputs only the id of nodes
* `tags` - outputs only the id and tags attached to a node
* `skel` - outputs only the id and geometry
* `body` - output id, geometry and tags
* `meta` - output id, geometry, tags plus change history

Because they don't include any coordinates, the first two options will cause
OverpassQL to only show you some XML output. As it can't generate a map from a
list of ids and tags.

Run the query, trying different parameters. You can click around on the map to
see the different levels of detail provided.

If you look closely when using the `body` and `meta` options, you'll see that
the majority of nodes returned don't have any tags. This is typically because these
nodes are being used in a way or relation. For example, to describe the location of a
road or footpath. They aren't points of interest in their own right.

//OverpassTurbo still can't draw a map, but some nodes will now
//have extra information in the XML output.

//TRYME #2 try these other variants. After running each
//one, click on some nodes to see how the returned data varies by
