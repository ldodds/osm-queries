/*
Filters applied to queries for nodes, ways and relations can be combined to
build up more complex expressions.

Any number of filters can be appended to query statements. They must all apply for
the a feature to be included in the results.

In this example we combine a key-value match with a regular expression to
match nodes that are tagged as cave entrances and whose name starts with
"Kulpi" in Pitjantjatjara.

The comments show a variation that illustrates querying for nodes that have a
`name` tag but don't also have a name specified in Pitjantjatjara.
