/*
The previous example illustrated how to turn an area into a way, so that we
can plot it on the map. For that we used the `pivot` filter.

Sometimes it can be helpful to go the other way and find the area that
corresponds to a way or relation. To do that we use the `map_to_area` statement.

This allows us to then do spatial queries using that area, which we can't do with
the original way or relation.

For example in this query we find the OSM relation tagged as Mutitjulu.

This is intended to represent an administrative boundary for the Mutitjulu community
that is found just east of Uluá¹Ÿu. This is stored in a temporary named set.

We then use the `map_to_area` statement to find the area corresponding to
that relation. This is saved in a variable called `mutitjulu`.

We then do a couple of type agnostic queries to find node, ways and relations
that are tagged as buildings or leisure areas.
