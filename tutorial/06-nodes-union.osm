/*
Sometimes when we are querying for data, we want to build up a larger collection of nodes
(or ways, or relations) that we are interested in. For example, a collection of
different types of road, amenities or natural features.

Rather than do this in multiple separate queries, we can extract that collection
using a single query, using a union.

In OverpassQL we create a union by specifying a block using curved brackets (`()`).
Within that block we can include all of the queries necessary to build our collection
of results.

For example, this query will return all those nodes that have been tagged with the
`tourism` tag AND those tagged as a cave entrance. We use separate individual `node` statements
to build up the collection we want.

The `out` statement then outputs the combined results.

This type of query is useful in any database operation. But its particularly useful for
querying the OpenStreetMap database because:

* we are often extracting different types of features, e.g. nodes, ways and relations, and its easier to get these in one pass
* nodes (and ways, and relations) can be tagged in different ways, so we often need to specify variations of tags to collect the features of interest
* by building up larger sets, we can do more complex queries that involve set operations

We'll cover set operations and variables in a later example.
