/*
Overpass queries consist of statements that query the OSM database to build
up a set of results which can be serialised into different output formats.

That set of results has a name. It's called `_`(underscore).

All of the queries we've written so far have implicitly worked with this result
set.

Our `node` queries have added results to the `_` set and the `out` statements
have used the default set to produce our output.

The query below makes this use of the default set explicit by naming it in
each statement.

The results of a statement can be written to a set using the `->` operator.

As we'll see in the following examples it is possible to create, manipulate
and produce output from multiple named sets of results.
