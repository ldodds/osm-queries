/*
This query selects all of nodes that are within a bounding box.

A bounding box is a rectangle that defines a geographic area. In OverpassQL a bounding box
is defined by four values. The first two define the south-west corner of the box. The
second pair defines its north east corner.

There are two main ways to define a bounding box within an OverpassQL query.

This example defines a bounding box that applies to the whole query. This is achieved using
a query setting called "`bbox`".

Query settings provide a way to control how the entire query runs. Query settings appear
at the start of a query and are defined with square brackets: `[]`.

Here we're using the `bbox` setting. As we'll see later, other settings let us
choose different output formats and tweak timeouts.

In the `bbox` setting we're providing the coordinates for a bounding box.
These particular coordinates (`25.38653, 130.99883, -25.31478, 131.08938`) define a rectangle that
includes Uluṟu. The sandstone monolith in Uluṟu-Kata Tjuta National Park, Australia.

The second way to define a bounding box is as a parameter to a statement.

To test this out, run the query in Overpass Turbo, then follow the instructions in the `TRYME #1`
comment to see that the bounding box is applied.

If you define a bounding box using a fixed set of points, then the query will
only ever use that geographic area. But sometimes you want to run a query over
whatever section of the map you're currently looking at.

The Overpass Turbo IDE provides a third way to define a bounding box. But automatically
inserting the coordinates for the current map view into your query.
This is specified by including the "`{{box}}`" shortcut instead of the coordinates. Overpass Turbo will then adjust
your query before its run.

This won't happen if you submit a query directly to the API. Its only a feature of the IDE. But
helpful when you're writing queries interactively.

When should you use the different variations?

* if you're using the same bounding box across your query, use a query setting. It makes the query more readable
* if you need to apply a bounding box to a single statement, then define it as a filter
* if you're writing a query intended to be used interactively within Overpass Turbo then use `{{bbox}}`
* if you're querying the API directly, always submit queries using specific coordinates. `{{bbox}}` won't work
