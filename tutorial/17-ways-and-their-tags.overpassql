/*
When querying for ways we can apply everything we've learned from querying
for nodes.

That includes filtering them based on their tags. Or using them to search
nearby on the map.

The query below selects just those ways in our bounding box that have been
tagged as a tourist attraction. As the time of writing, that results in a
single way which marks out the boundary of Uluá¹Ÿu.

See the query comments for other variations to try, including finding
highways, footpaths and amenities near to paths.
