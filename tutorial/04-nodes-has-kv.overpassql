/*
This query illustrates other ways to find nodes based on their tags and the
values of those tags.

Tags and their values can be filtered by:

* existence, e.g. whether a tag is or isn't present on the nodes
* by value, e.g. whether a tag has a specific value
* by regular expression matching tag values, e.g. whether the value of a tag matches a specific pattern
* by regular expression matching tag names and values, e.g. where names and values match (different) patterns

Together these provide a lot of flexibility.

Later in the tutorial we'll learn how to do free text searches to find features
of the map. But this is an IDE specific extension and not a feature of the basic
Overpass API.
