/*
John Wood, the Elder had a big influence on the architecture and design of
Bath. Many of the buildings he designed into masonic symbols and icons.

His design for the Circus, Gay Street and Queen Squre in Bath creates the
shape of a key.

This query selects the ways and relations that define that shape in the
OSM database and then uses MapCSS to style them.
