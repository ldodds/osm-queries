This project contains both the source for the [OSM Queries website](https://osm-queries.ldodds.com) and the
HTML which is served via github pages.

Each of the project directories contains a collection of Overpass QL queries
saved with the `.overpassql` file extension.

The content is generated using the [Overpass Doc](https://github.com/ldodds/overpass-doc) tool.
This converts a directory of query and markdown files to generate a simple website.
